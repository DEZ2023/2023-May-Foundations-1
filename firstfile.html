                It was a sunny day in Philadelphia. The Liberty Bell 
                had a clue for Nicholas Cage, which he shared with 
                a blond woman whose name I can't remember.

                The bad guys locked Nicholas Cage and Jon Voight 
                and the others underneath the Trinity Lutheran Church 
                while they chased a fake clue. Harvey Keitel arrested 
                them at the Old North something.
